    "# About\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "The MTA's GTFS and GTFS-Realtime datastreams use the same identifiers, and their identifiers need to be folded into one another to maximize what we know.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately this is *very* non-trivial. The MTA's data dictionary has a long, long passage on the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The New York City subway is a 24 x 7 operations and as a result is a highly dynamic operation. The majority of repairs and maintenance are performed during live operations so the daily service plan is subject to both planned and unplanned changes. The result of this is that some trips defined in the GTFS trips.txt may change (originating times, trip running times and trip path), cancelled or new trips may be added. \n",
    ">\n",
    "> Unfortunately, there is no reliable way for us to determine the relationship between the actual and the static GTFS trip, so we can’t tell if a particular trip is the original one or has been changed or added later so the ScheduleRelationship is not used. While trip_id in the GTFS-realtime feed will not directly match the trip_id in trips.txt, a partial match should be possible if the trip has been defined in trips.txt. If there is a partial match, the trip is a scheduled trip.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> For example, if a trip_id in trips.txt is A20111204SAT_021150_2..N08R, the GTFS-realtime trip_id will\n",
    "be 021150_2..N08R which is unique within the day type (WKD, SAT, SUN). A20111204SAT_021150_2..N08R is decoded as follows:\n",
    "> \n",
    "> A – Is the Sub-Division identifier. A identifies Sub-Division A (IRT) which include the GC Shuttle and all number lines with the exception of the 7 line. B identifies Sub-Division B (BMT and IND) which includes the Franklin Ave and Rockaway Shuttles, all letter lines and the 7 line.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 20111204 – Effective date of the base schedule, Dec 4, 2011\n",
    ">\n",
    "> SAT – Is the applicable service code. Typically it will be WKD-Weekday, SAT-Saturday or SUNSunday\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 021150 – This identifies the trips origin time. Times are coded reflecting hundredths of a minute past midnight and converts to (03:31:30 also described as 0331+ where the + equals 30 seconds). This format provides more \"precision\" than can be realistically attributed to a transit operation, and most applications can safely round or truncate these numbers to the nearest minute. Since Transit authority internal timetables frequently involve half-minute scheduling, systems involved in train control or monitoring will need to represent times in a more accurate manner (to at least the half minute, and perhaps to the tenth minute or one second level). It should be noted that the service associated with a single day's subway schedule is not necessarily confined to a twenty-four hour period. Negative numbers reflect times prior to the day of the schedule (-0000200 refers to 11:58 PM yesterday) and\n",
    "numbers exceeding 00144000 (a day has 1440 minutes) reflect times beyond the day of the schedule (00145000 refers to 12:10 AM tomorrow).\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 2..N08R – This identifies the Trip Path (stopping pattern) for a unique train trip. This can be decomposed into the Route ID (aka service, 2 train) Direction (Northbound train) and Path Identifier (08R). Internally this path provides operations planning such information as origination, destination, all stops, routing scheme (express/local) in Manhattan/Bronx/Brooklyn, operating time periods, and shape (circle = local, diamond = express).\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The combination of Origin Time, Route ID and Direction can be used to identify a unique trip. The Path Identifier should be considered optional data that will only be provided when known. This could result with it being there at the start of a trip but not during portions of the trip.\n",
    "\n",
    "The TLDR is that GTFS provides us all of the *static* information about the MTA, while GTFS-Realtime provides all of the *dynamic* information. In the complicated, aging, 24/7-on MTA system, this difference between expectation and reality isn't a just a gap, it's a chasm.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means that in general, there are three types of train trips:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Train trips that were to occur in the GTFS plan, but did not occur in the GTFS-Realtime reality.\n",
    "2. Train trips that occurred in the GTFS-Realtime reality, but not in the GTFS plan.\n",
    "3. Train trips that occurred both in planning and reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tooling\n",
    "\n",
    "To start with, we're going to need to grab a tool for reading that GTFS data in (I could build my own, but why re-invent the wheel?).\n",
    "\n",
    "Google publishes the [`transitfeed`](https://github.com/google/transitfeed) library for this purpose. However, that library is Python 2 only. Boo.\n",
    "\n",
    "So instead we'll use the competently done [`pygtfs`](https://github.com/jarondl/pygtfs)."

    "## Modelling\n",
    "\n",
    "With that in mind, we're going to need to organize a mental model for organizing all of this information together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our frame of reference is going to be individual \"trip sets\". Each trip execution will consist of two trips: the one that occured in reality, and the one that was planned. Sometimes these two trips will be the same. Sometimes we will only have information on one of these trips: either a trip that was planned but didn't happen (or couldn't be matched to one that happened), or a trip that was unplanned but did happen. Sometimes there will be a trip that was planned, and one that occurred, but they won't be the same. We need to account for all of these possibilities, in theory (in practice, we will see).\n",
    "\n",
    "These trips executions will have metadata regarding what line and route they occurred along, which we will read out of the requisite GTFS files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will create and store information about alerts. Alerts occur in [place, place] segments of a trip. That place may be a station, or it may be the space in between stations, and it includes the spaces both before the first and after the last stop on a trip. Later on we will probably want to assign some sort of classification system to the alerts that we see, but for now, just storing the text string associated with the alert will do, so long as we have this lengthwise spatial extent worked out alright.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, we will assume `trip_planned -> trip_executed` is *injective*, but not *bijective*. That is, if we started with one executed trip, we will assume that the most we can do is match one planned trip. However, we will not assume that the reverse is true: that is, we will assume that it may be possible for a single planned trip to map to multiple executed trips. An easy example might be when something goes cataclysmically wrong at one station in particular, so the trains on a route run in two segments: one there from before, and one there from afterwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "I expect that the reverse is also possible. However, we need to match trips from some starting point, and it only makes sense to try to do so backwards: to start at a trip that happened, and work backwards to a trip that was planned. This is an injective worldview.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm going to organize things using objects, but I'm mainly interested in serializing these things to JSON representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important limitation of this data model is that we will be storing information that is accurately localized to a single line. For example, if a service disruption occurs that affects many lines, each of the trips that occur that are affected across all of these lines will duplicate information on the disruption. We have to accept limitations like this one, for now, because the data is just so multimodal; in order to flatten it somewhat, we have to make compromises somewhere. Otherwise we end up with a tree that's barely different from the one that we started with!"
