* gtfs/* --- GTFS-format data as provided by the MTA as downloaded and unzipped on June 9 2017.
* gtfs-realtime/failed-request_permission-error.pkl --- A pickled `requests.Response` object containing a request against MTA GTFS-Realtime Feed 1 at approximately 1:40 PM on 3 July, 2017. At this time, this feed was down, cyclicly returning Permission Denied to all requests made to it. This pickled response is kept as an example of what happens when such a failure occurs, and for use in testing. Note: this response would also be returned if your API Key is invalid.
* gtfs-realtime/failed-request_truncated-message.pkl --- A pickled `requests.Response` object corresponding with a GTFS-Realtime feed that contains truncated content. This is a form of an erronous response that will occassionally be returned if you happen to hit the server during its read-lock update process (in other words, the GTFS-R stream is not fully atomic). Note that in this scenario, it is also sometimes possible to get a 404 response.
